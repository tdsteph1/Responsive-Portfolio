# Responsive-Portfolio

# Instructions(Bootstrap)
Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:



A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)


eg. On xs and sm screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On m and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid


Responsive images.

We are using Bootstrap 3 to ensure that all elements fit on the screen whenever the user decides to minimize the screen. Also Bootsrap makes each of the pages that I designed much more elegant in terms of sizing and color.
